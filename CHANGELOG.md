# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.5] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **First-visit domain connect prompt** — when an unknown site makes a NIP-07 request, the extension popup opens automatically showing the existing "Connect this site" card; the request waits up to 2 minutes for the user to click Connect, replacing the previous silent rejection
- **Dismissed domains** — domains the user has previously declined are silently rejected on subsequent NIP-07 requests; manually connecting a dismissed domain via the GlobeButton clears the dismissal
- **`waitForDomainAllowed()`** — background utility that listens for `storage.onChanged` to detect when a domain is added to the allowlist
- **Tests** — `domain-handlers.test.ts` with 10 tests covering dismissed domain CRUD and interaction with allowed domains

### Changed
- **NIP-07 domain gate** — unknown domains now trigger the popup instead of silent rejection; dismissed domains are still silently blocked
- **NIP-65 relay discovery (outbox model)** — sync engine now fetches kind:10002 relay list events alongside kind:3 contact lists, storing per-pubkey read/write relay preferences in a new `relay_lists` IndexedDB store (DB v3) with in-memory cache and batched writes
- **Relay pool with dynamic connection expansion** — tracks which relays are endorsed by follows' write-relay declarations; after depth-0 sync completes, top-endorsed relays are connected automatically (up to 10 total connections)
- **Outbox-aware profile fetching** — `fetchProfileMetadata` and `fetchMuteList` now prepend the target pubkey's declared write-relays before falling back to configured relays
- **WoT API: `getRelayList(pubkey)`** — returns a pubkey's stored NIP-65 relay list (read/write preferences) via `window.nostr.wot`
- **WoT API: `getRelayPool()`** — returns the top 50 relays ranked by follow endorsement count via `window.nostr.wot`
- **Relay URL normalization** — `normalizeRelayUrl()` lowercases and strips trailing slashes for consistent deduplication
- **Relay list parsing** — `parseRelayListTags()` extracts read/write relay entries from kind:10002 event tags with deduplication, wss-only filtering, and a 20-entry cap
- **Relay discovery constants** — `RELAY_POOL_MAX_SIZE`, `RELAY_POOL_MIN_ENDORSEMENTS`, `MAX_RELAYS_PER_EVENT` in `lib/constants.ts`
- **Storage stats** — `relayListCount` added to `StorageStats` type and `getStats()` output
- **Tests** — `sync-relay-discovery.test.ts` (pure function tests for parsing, normalization, relay pool), `storage-relay-lists.test.ts` (IndexedDB relay list storage with fake-indexeddb)
- **Dev dependencies** — `fake-indexeddb`, `ws`, `@types/ws` for relay discovery testing

## [0.3.4] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **WebLN zaps broken in Coracle and other clients** — `webln_getInfo` was missing the `supports: ['lightning']` field that clients check to verify Lightning capability; `webln_enable` now adds the requesting domain to the allowed domains list (the standard WebLN connection handshake)

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-13

### Changed
- **Comprehensive code review (Round 2)** — 10 parallel Opus agents audited the full codebase covering security, performance, code quality, dead code, documentation accuracy, and future enhancements; 70 new findings documented in `docs/code-review.md`
- **Misc-handlers split** — `misc-handlers.ts` (507 lines) split into `activity-handlers.ts`, `profile-handlers.ts`, `publish-handlers.ts`; original file is now a re-export facade
- **Graph module hardened** — underscore-prefixed methods replaced with `private` modifier; all 11 internal call sites updated
- **NIP-07 input validation** — added `event.tags` validation (array of string arrays) and `event.created_at` validation (integer, not >1 hour in future)
- **signEvent zeroing contract** — comprehensive JSDoc documenting caller responsibility for key zeroing
- **LNbits HTTP warning** — console.warn added when admin key is sent over non-localhost HTTP

### Fixed
- **Permission cache test failures** — added `storage.onChanged` support to browser mock so in-memory caches invalidate correctly between tests
- **Wallet balance assertions** — fixed msats-to-sats conversion in NWC test mocks (values now in millisats, expected results in sats)
- **Import extensions** — standardized all 17 test files from `.js` to `.ts` import extensions
- **nostr-tools/pure removal** — replaced `generateSecretKey`/`getPublicKey` imports with own crypto; only `nostr-tools/nip46` remains
- **IDB upgrade deduplication** — extracted shared `upgradeDatabase()` helper from duplicate `onupgradeneeded` callbacks
- **NODE_ENV** — changed from `'development'` to `'production'` in vite.config.ts

### Added
- `lib/constants.ts` — centralized magic numbers (timeouts, rate limits, crypto parameters)
- `lib/utils/async-lock.ts` — shared async mutex (extracted from duplicated `withStorageLock` pattern)
- `lib/bg/activity-handlers.ts` — activity log handlers with write buffering
- `lib/bg/profile-handlers.ts` — profile metadata and mute list handlers
- `lib/bg/publish-handlers.ts` — event signing, broadcasting, and NIP-46 session handlers
- `docs/code-review.md` — comprehensive Round 2 audit with 70 findings and prioritized roadmap

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-10

### Changed
- **Modularized background service worker** — split the monolithic `background.ts` (~2800 lines) into 8 focused handler modules under `lib/bg/`: state, wot-handlers, misc-handlers, domain-handlers, vault-handlers, wallet-handlers, nip07-handlers, onboarding-handlers; background.ts is now a ~300-line orchestrator with Map-based dispatch
- **Code quality improvements** — eliminated duplicate types (`DistanceInfo`, `LocalAccountEntry`), extracted shared helpers (`resetLocalGraph`, `buildStrategyCSS`, `withIdentityGuard`), converted key zeroing to try/finally pattern, removed dead code and unnecessary exports

### Fixed
- **Sats display shows whole numbers** — wallet balance, transaction amounts, invoice previews, and payment prompts no longer show decimal fractions
- **Wallet setup banner persists after setup** — the "Set up wallet" banner on the home screen now disappears immediately after configuring a wallet, instead of requiring a restart

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-10

### Changed
- **Unminified builds** — all production builds (Chrome and Firefox) now output fully readable, unminified JavaScript including vendor dependencies (React, ReactDOM); required for store review compliance
- Vite config enforces `minify: false` and resolves development builds of all dependencies
- Removed redundant `--minify false` CLI flags from package scripts (now enforced at config level)

### Fixed
- Firefox and Chrome store submissions were rejected due to minified/obfuscated code in bundled output

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Lightning Wallet (WebLN)** — built-in Lightning wallet support with WebLN provider (`window.webln`) for sending and receiving zaps directly from Nostr clients
- **Quick Wallet Setup** — one-click wallet provisioning via zaps.nostr-wot.com with challenge-response authentication; no account registration needed
- **Lightning Address** — claim a `username@zaps.nostr-wot.com` address to receive payments; view, copy, add to profile, and unlink from wallet settings
- **BOLT11 invoice decoder** — lightweight payment request parser for previewing invoice details (amount, description, expiry) before sending
- **LNbits manual connect** — connect your own LNbits instance with admin key
- **NWC connect** — connect any Nostr Wallet Connect compatible wallet
- **NWC auto-provisioning** — provisioned wallets automatically get an NWC connection URI for use in other apps
- **Wallet UI** — balance display, deposit invoices with QR codes, send modal with invoice preview, auto-approve threshold for zaps
- **Wallet balance card** — home screen shows current wallet balance with quick access to wallet settings
- **WebLN permission system** — per-domain approval for `sendPayment` with remember option
- **Payment approval overlay** — pending zap requests shown in popup with approve/deny actions
- **Unlock modal improvements** — shows pending signing requests with per-request cancel and cancel-all options

### Changed
- **Port-based messaging** — NIP-07 and WebLN requests use persistent port connections to keep the service worker alive during long operations (vault unlock, NIP-46 remote signing)
- **WebLN `enable()` always succeeds** — apps that call `enable()` on page load (like Primal) no longer get permanently locked out when the vault is locked
- **Version moved to single source of truth** — extension version is read from the manifest at runtime instead of being duplicated across locale files
- Manifest description updated to "Nostr identity provider, NIP-07 signer, and Web of Trust provider"

### Fixed
- **Auto-unlock removed** — popup no longer forces vault unlock on every open; unlock only triggered by explicit user action or pending signing requests
- **Service worker lifetime** — NIP-07 and WebLN operations no longer fail when Chrome suspends the service worker mid-request
- **WebLN payment approval was invisible** — `webln_sendPayment` requests were missing `needsPermission: true`, making them appear in the badge count but not in the approval overlay
- Removed stale debug `console.log` statements from NIP-07 and WebLN handlers

## [0.2.0] - 2025-02-24

### Added

- **Per-account IndexedDB** — each identity gets its own `nostr-wot-{accountId}` database
- **Onboarding wizard** — first-run setup flow for account creation and import
- **Signing prompt system** — popup window for approving/denying NIP-07 requests with remember option
- **Permission system** — per-domain, per-method, per-event-kind permission storage and cascade
